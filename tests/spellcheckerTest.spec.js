 * This script sets up Playwright's testing environment and imports a spell 
 * checker utility for automated validation. It includes the `test` and `expect` 
 * modules from Playwright to facilitate testing. The `spellcheckerUtils` helper, 
 * which utilizes the `typo-js` library for spell checking, is imported but not 
 * yet executed. The commented-out function call suggests that the spell checker 
 * may be designed to integrate with Playwright tests.
