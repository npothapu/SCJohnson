FUTURE PREPAREDNESS

Chasing the Dream Career: Can Teens Balance Passion and Practicality?

PUBLISHED DATE: NOVEMBER 26, 2024

For today’s teens, career ambitions are driven more by the heart than the wallet—but there’s a twist. When asked what matters most in a job, 43% chose "a job they would love to do," far outpacing the 28% who prioritized pay. Yet, most teens acknowledge that passion and pay go hand in hand, with 59% acknowledging that a job must pay well for them to love it.

“I just want to have a job that I love that will provide for my future family,” says a 15-year-old male from California. Similarly, an 18-year-old female from Texas dreams of “being stable, doing what I love, and providing for myself and my family.”
Dream Job Reality Check
While teens hold high career aspirations, many doubt they’ll achieve their goals. The survey reveals significant gaps between what teens value and what they believe is attainable:

- Job that I love: 71% rate it as important, but only 55% believe they’ll achieve it.
Job that pays well: 68% value it, but just 54% expect it.
Job that I’m good at: 68% prioritize it, but only 57% feel confident they’ll find it. Asian teens report the most significant gaps between aspirations and confidence. For example, 61% rate finding work they’re good at as important, but only 42% are confident they’ll succeed.

Other notable differences include:

- White teens are the most likely to prioritize finding a job they’re good at (73%).
Black teens express the highest confidence in landing well-paying jobs (58%, compared to 54% overall).
Better Grades, Brighter Future?
Teens with higher academic achievement tend to be more optimistic about their career prospects. They express greater confidence in areas like finding work they love, work they’re good at, and work that pays well. This suggests that academic success plays a role in shaping a positive outlook for the future.
Passion vs. Pay? Why Not Both?
While many teens wrestle with doubts about achieving their career goals, some remain optimistic about finding balance. As one 14-year-old female from the South says, "When you do what you love, you'll love what you do, and the money will come after."

CRINGEY OR COOL? What Teens Really Think About Trendiness in Ads

PUBLISHED DATE: NOVEMBER 26, 2024

Nothing catches a marketer's attention quite like a shiny new trend. But trend hopping comes with significant risks, especially today, as viral moments catch fire and flame out faster than you can flick a BIC.

In October, we surveyed 1,971 13- to 19-year-olds about brands using trends in their ads. Their responses ranged from enthusiasm to eye rolls. Some teens appreciate the effort. “It’s cool because it shows that the brand knows what's recent and how to get some people's attention,” says a 14-year-old White male from Texas. But others, like this 16-year-old White female in Iowa, offer some pretty colorful critiques, “It's like your parent wearing a crop top,” she says. “You can't stop them from doing it, but you don't have to like it.”
Cultural Connection Over Viral Tricks
While many marketing strategies focus on leveraging the latest TikTok features or Instagram filters, the data shows teens are increasingly drawn to broader cultural movements. Music-related trends lead the pack, with 55% of teens responding positively, while only 25% appreciate video filters and 28% connect with trending audio overlays.

Some tactics consistently resonate: humor plays a significant role in teens' positive reception of trend-based ads, with females particularly favoring funny content (45%). Nearly the same number of teens think it's cool when brands change their logos to incorporate trends (48%) and recreate viral videos featuring their products (47%).

Using slang is an “enter at your own risk” kind of situation. The data shows an almost even split, with 32% of teens calling it cool and similar numbers finding it cringe-worthy. “Who's in charge of their marketing team?” asks a 15-year old Hispanic female from Georgia. “I know young people are the main target audience, but like, using our slang is kind of desperate.”

One significant insight from our survey is how quickly teens tire of trends once they hit the mainstream. Oversaturation, association with older audiences, or being co-opted by influencers can rapidly make a trend uncool. “When brands use trends after they've been around for more than two weeks, it becomes old, and it just seems cringey, like with the “very demure and mindful” trend, says a 15-year-old Hispanic female in Texas.
For trend use to feel authentic, the research identified three critical elements:

1. Natural Product Integration: When brands force their products into trends artificially, 43% of teens react negatively. A 17-year-old White female from Indiana explains: “I think it is out of touch or not cool whenever the trend isn't relative to the item they're trying to sell.”

2. Brand Alignment: Forty-two percent of teens dislike when companies use trends that do not relate to their brand identity. The expectations vary by industry—82% of teens expect entertainment companies to engage with trends, while only 56% expect it from financial services.

3. The Right Tone: Teens sense when brands are pandering to them. A 17-year-old Hispanic female in New Jersey says she doesn’t like ads that are “…clearly written by old men that have no idea how Gen Z or Gen Alpha actually act.”

Perhaps the most useful piece of advice one can take from the survey is to check in with teens. “Don't just grab a random person and force them to do a TikTok trend,” says a 16-year-old male from Massachusetts. “Have a young kid watch the ad and tell you if it's cringey before posting. It's not hard.”

DIGITAL LIFE

Teens and Social Media: It’s Complicated

PUBLISHED DATE: OCTOBER 23, 2024

Teenagers scrolling through social media, their faces illuminated by the glow of their screens—it’s a scene practically emblematic of modern life. While the sight may be familiar, what’s going on is far from simple. A new study by teen research and insights firm TeenVoice reveals teens’ relationship with social media is both complex and contradictory. The research surveyed 2,004 diverse teens from across the U.S. and paints a nuanced portrait of a generation navigating the double-edged sword of digital connection. As a 16-year-old Hispanic male from California says: "Social media is beneficial for teens because it’s a good tool for inspiration, but when people get hooked on validation online it gets really unhealthy."
Constantly Checking, But…Whatever
The numbers are staggering: 98% of teens use at least one social media platform daily. On average, teens juggle four different platforms a day, with YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram emerging as the most popular. Yet, when asked about the importance of social media in their lives, few teens rate it as "very" or "extremely" important, meaning there’s a disconnect between usage and perceived importance of these platforms in teens’ lives.
Feels Good–Most of the Time
Regarding social media’s emotional impact, teens report a mix of positive and negative experiences. After spending time on social media, 64% feel entertained, 48% feel connected, and 47% feel inspired or happy. These positive emotions suggest that social media fulfills many teens’ essential social and emotional needs.

However, the picture isn't entirely rosy. The same platforms also breed negative emotions. Nearly a third of teens report feeling stressed after using social media, while more than a quarter feel anxious, angry, or depressed.

A 16-year-old mixed race trans individual from Washington captures this duality: "I believe teenagers benefit from using social media in the sense that it connects them further with their friends. They can share happy moments…and see moments their friends shared as well. This is also the bad part of social media as most teenagers will develop FOMO Fear Of Missing Out.”

Interestingly, taking breaks from social media doesn't necessarily lead to emotional relief. While disconnecting makes 44% of teens feel calm, significant percentages still experience stress (31%), anxiety (30%), and depression (28%) when away from these platforms.
Negative Feelings Hit Some Groups Harder
The study reveals notable differences in how various demographic groups experience social media. Female teens, White teens, and those identifying as LGBTQ+ report higher levels of anxiety, stress, depression, and FOMO after scrolling compared to their counterparts.

In terms of racial differences, Black teens report lower levels of anxiety from social media use, while Asian teens are less likely to feel entertained, happy, or intellectually stimulated.

Location also plays a role with urban teens more likely to view social media positively than their rural or suburban peers.
The Mental Health Paradox
Health experts are increasingly concerned about the relationship between teens and social media. U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and the American Psychological Association (APA) have issued advisories highlighting the growing evidence of social media's detrimental effects on young people's mental well-being. Dr. Murthy has even called for cigarette-style warning labels on social media platforms. And in a related development, a coalition of attorneys general from across the country filed a lawsuit against TikTok in October 2024, alleging that the platform's addictive nature harms young people's mental health.

These concerns seem reflected in teens’ attitudes. Despite enjoying and benefiting from social media use, nearly 30% of teens don't believe it positively affects their mental well-being. Furthermore, about a third of teens disagree with the statement, “Social media impacts most teenagers’ mental health in a positive way.” This paradox suggests that while teens may recognize the personal benefits of social media, they are also aware of its potential negative impact on themselves and their peers.

A 15-year-old White female from Michigan pointedly observes, “Previous generations never had social media, and while they may have had depression or anxiety, there is NOW an epidemic of mental health issues. Coincidence much? I think not.”

And a 14-year-old White male from Indiana offers this warning, “We are all in our world, but it’s not Earth. It’s the cyber world. If it doesn’t stop soon then a lot of people will continue to be sad, and depression in teens will only be more common.”
Both The Problem And The Solution
When it comes to managing stress and mental health, teens again show a conflicted approach to social media. Nearly half believe that disconnecting from stressful media is a good way to cope with mental health struggles. Yet, a similar proportion views social media as an effective distraction from stress and a platform for sharing mental health experiences.

A 19-year-old female from New York shares her experience: “I started feeling a lot better when I deleted Instagram and Twitter. I feel like people would be a lot happier without social media. It’s…used to spread so much toxicity, like some of the comment sections, especially on Instagram and Twitter. It's just really depressing."

On the other hand, a 16-year-old White Female from Illinois offers a balanced perspective: "I believe teenagers benefit by being able to interact when they wouldn’t, but it also can be harmful because lots of things on social are completely stupid stuff that everyone believes."

This duality suggests that teens see social media as both a potential source of and solution to mental health challenges.
A World Of Contradiction
Connection and isolation, joy and stress, empowerment and vulnerability, nothing in teens’ digital lives is as simple as a like or share. This study shows that the relationship between teens and social media remains deeply nuanced and multifaceted
Key Takeaways
High Usage, Low Importance: Nearly all teens (98%) use social media daily, juggling multiple platforms. Yet, few consider social media very important to their lives, indicating a disconnect between frequent usage and perceived value.

Mixed Emotional Impact: While social media often makes teens feel entertained, connected, and inspired, it also leads to negative emotions like stress, anxiety, and depression for a significant portion.

Demographic Disparities: Negative feelings like stress, anxiety, and depression are more common among female teens, LGBTQ+ teens, and White teens. Black teens report lower anxiety, while Asian teens feel less entertained and happy using social media.

Mental Health Concern: Teens recognize social media’s impact on mental health, with many doubting its positive effects despite continued use. Health experts and legal actions highlight growing concerns about its harmful influence.

Contradictory Solutions: Teens are conflicted about whether social media helps or harms their mental health, seeing it both as a source of stress and a tool for coping or distraction.

Complex Relationship: Overall, teens’ relationship with social media is nuanced, marked by both connection and isolation, joy and stress.

Methodology
TeenVoice has developed an innovative approach to understanding today's youth, setting us apart from companies that rely on traditional surveys and outdated techniques. We've crafted unique methods to reach, engage, and communicate with teens in their preferred environments, encouraging more authentic interactions. Our approach allows us to capture deeper insights into their thoughts, mental health, and overall well-being. The studies we produce reflect the digital landscape teens inhabit and highlight important demographic nuances across age, gender, race, ethnicity, and geography. This special report on teens and social media is excerpted from one of three robust studies conducted in March and April of 2024 involving over 6,000 7th through 12th graders throughout the U.S.

TEEN LIFE

Where Teens Talk Politics

PUBLISHED DATE: OCTOBER 21, 2024

Politics permeates the daily lives of American teenagers, whether they actively seek it out or not. A recent survey of 1,790 teens reveals how discussions with family, friends, and teachers shape their political perspectives, while social media provides a platform for sharing and engaging with diverse opinions.
Around the Dinner Table
For many teens, political awareness begins at home. A significant 62% of those surveyed report having political discussions with their parents at least weekly. As a 13-year-old White male from Arizona explains, "I am interested in politics because my family cares about it." This sentiment is echoed by a 13-year-old female from California: "I hear about it all the time in my household, so I end up getting involved in the conversation, making me more and more interested."
With Friends and at School
Over half of the surveyed teens (52%) say they discuss politics with their friends at least weekly. A 14-year-old Asian male from Maryland, for example, says he stays up to date on political events specifically so he can participate in discussions with his peers. Even those not actively looking to talk about politics find it a frequent topic in class. A 15-year-old nonbinary Hispanic person notes, "It isn't something that comes up in conversations with my friends, but sometimes it comes up in news or in my Social Studies class."
Sharing Views on Social Media
Teens are more likely to share or repost political content they agree with (23%) than to create original content (18%). This preference for sharing curated content reflects a broader trend in social media use among teens. (To go deeper into teens social media habits, download our report.) The pressure to fit in also plays a significant role, with 15% of teens admitting they've been dishonest about their political opinions and 14% confessing they've exaggerated their knowledge to avoid seeming uninformed.
Gender and Racial Disparities
Generally, female teens are more likely to discuss politics with their families than males, with 40% of girls getting political information from their families compared to 28% of boys. Additionally, teens of color tend to engage more frequently in political discussions, particularly with their families, where 35% report receiving much of their political information.
Key Takeaways
Family Conversations Matter: Political awareness often begins at home, with 62% of teens engaging in weekly discussions with their parents.

Outside The Home: Over half of the teens talk about politics with friends and encounter it through classes.

Social Media Sharing Trends: 23% of teens share or repost political content created by others, though fears of backlash cause 22% to avoid posting their own views.

Peer Pressure and Politics: 15% of teens have lied about their political views to fit in, while 14% have exaggerated their knowledge.

Gender and Racial Disparities: Female teens and teens of color are more likely to engage in political discussions, especially within their families.

Where Do Teens Get Their Political Information? The Answer May Surprise You

PUBLISHED DATE: OCTOBER 15, 2024

Conventional wisdom says teens get all their information—including political news—online. Our recent survey of 1,783 teens challenges that assumption, revealing that teens get political information from diverse sources, including some traditional media, like television news.
Television News Dominates
Teens not only watch TV news, but it’s also their primary source of political information. A substantial 43% of teenagers turn to TV news as their go-to source for understanding politics.

Interestingly, there are notable demographic differences. Female teens (47%) are more likely to rely on TV news than their male counterparts (36%). Additionally, there’s a significant increase in TV news consumption as teens age, with 56% of 19-year-olds citing it as a primary source compared to only 39% of 13-14-year-olds.
Family First, Er, Second
Family conversations are crucial in shaping teens' political knowledge, ranking as the second most important source. Approximately 35% of teens discuss politics with family members, particularly their parents.“My dad pays attention to politics a lot and talks about it with me, says a 15-year-old White female from Wisconsin.

These discussions not only lead to knowledge but can also spark an interest in politics in general. A 17-year-old Black female from Washington, D.C., says, “I’m interested in politics because my parents are also interested.”

A look at demographics shows that female teens (40%) are more likely to engage in these conversations than males (28%). “My stepdad is very political, so I like learning from him, says a 13-year-old White female from Missouri.
School For The Bronze
Schools play a vital role in political socialization, with 32% of teens citing the classroom as a source of political information. The data reveals a disparity across gender identities. Teens who identify as “another gender” report significantly higher rates (49%) of gaining political information from school, compared to their female (33%) and male (29%) peers.

Additionally, there's a clear age-related trend, with older teens more likely to cite school as a source of political information. While only 25% of 13-14-year-olds report gaining political knowledge from school, this increases to 38% for 17-18-year-olds, likely reflecting more advanced coursework and discussions as students progress through high school.
And Finally, Sites, Apps, and Social
Of course, digital platforms remain a significant source for teens. About 30% of teens use network news apps and websites to stay informed. Social media also plays a role, with 28% of teens following news accounts on these platforms.

Demographic analysis shows that teens identifying as “another gender” are consistently more likely to use digital sources. For instance, 39% of these teens follow news accounts on social media, compared to 30% of female teens and 24% of male teens. This trend extends to other digital sources, like dedicated news apps and influencer accounts.

Age also plays a role in digital news consumption. Older teens (17-18 and 19-year-olds) are more likely to use network news apps and websites (37% and 38%, respectively) than their younger counterparts (27% for 13-14 year-olds).
A Varied Diet
The landscape of teen political information sources reveals a fascinating blend of old and new media and educational experiences. While television news maintains a surprising lead, the influence of family discussions, classroom learning, and digital platforms all contribute to shaping teens' political awareness.
Key Takeaways
Television News Dominates: 43% of teens use TV news as their main source of political information, with female and older teens more likely to rely on it.

Family Conversations: 35% of teens discuss politics with their families, shaping their political interest and understanding.

**School as a Source of Political Knowledge: ** 32% of teens report learning about politics in school, with teens identifying as "another gender" more likely to gain political information from school than female and male teens.

According to our latest survey of 1,783 teens, a solid 79% say it's crucial to start paying attention to politics before they're even old enough to vote, and 59% already know who they would vote for in the 2024 presidential election. "I think it's so important for younger generations to understand politics because we're the future of the world," says a 17-year-old Asian female from Massachusetts.
Starting Young
For many teens, the time to start tuning in is now. Twenty-eight percent say ages 14-15 is prime time to dive into political issues, while another 26% think 16-17 is just right. "Understanding political developments helps me make informed decisions, participate actively in civic duties, and engage in meaningful discussions about important topics affecting our community and the world," says a 14-year-old male from Colorado.

Of course, not all teens are rushing to engage. A 14-year-old White male from North Carolina takes a laid-back approach: "I prefer to let the adults worry about that stuff."
Issues Teens Care About
Economy (63%) Even though most teens aren't working full-time, the economy is still a significant stressor. A 15-year-old Black male from Connecticut worries the election “will change the landscape of the economy.” Others have more specific concerns. "Taxes are super confusing," admits a 17-year-old Black female from Florida. "All I know is that my paychecks were getting $100 or $150 taken out. I can only imagine adult paycheck deductions."

- Women's Health & Reproductive Rights (60%) It's been two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, but time hasn't made the issues of abortion and reproductive rights any less worrisome to teens. A 15-year-old Black female from California says, "The election will change history forever for women."

- Racial & Ethnic Inequality (58%) Like the 15-year-old White male from California who fears the election will lead to fewer human rights, social justice is a driving force for many teens. Says a 17-year-old White female from Colorado, “I care most about equal access to healthcare and other things that should be rights.”
Gender Divide
While teens share a lot of common ground, there are some gender differences in what sparks their interest. For example, more female teens are focused on women's health (68%) and gun control (57%) than their male peers (48% and 44%, respectively).
The Future Is Now
This survey makes clear that today's teens are already thinking about tomorrow. From social justice to the economy, they're fired up, informed, and ready to shape the world they're inheriting. "I know these political issues will eventually affect me and my family," says a 15-year-old Asian female from Michigan.

Still, not everyone's jumping in without hesitation. As a 17-year-old Black male from Florida says, “Political issues and events are interesting because they involve things that directly impact my life; however, they're tiring and mentally fatiguing because of polarization.”
Key Takeaways
Early Engagement: More than half (79%) of teens believe it's important to engage with politics before voting age, with most suggesting ages 14-17 as ideal starting points.

Issue Priorities: Top concerns among teens are:


Economy/inflation (63%)


Women's health and reproductive rights (60%)


Racial and ethnic inequality (58%)

Gender Differences: Female teens prioritize women’s health and gun control more than males.

Future Focused: Teens are focused on how today's political issues will impact their future.

Presidential Election Has Teens on Edge

PUBLISHED DATE: OCTOBER 8, 2024

This report kicks off our election coverage, revealing key findings from our September study on teen political attitudes and behaviors. New insights will be released weekly until Election Day.
Adults aren't the only ones feeling the weight of the upcoming election. Our recent study surveyed 1,783 teenagers and shows that teens are just as tuned in—and stressed out—by what's at stake. While many can't vote yet, their emotions and opinions give insight into the next generation of voters.
High Impact, High Anxiety
A striking 51% of teens rate the election's impact on their future as high” or “extreme.” “The election will have a huge impact on things like climate change and job opportunities, which are really important as I start thinking about my future,” says a 17-year-old White male from California. “It could also change how my generation deals with social issues and technology, shaping our lives in ways we might not fully understand yet.”
What Are Teens Feeling?
Concern: 37% of females, 24% of males, and 51% of nonbinary teens
Anxiety: 29% of females, 16% of males, and 44% of nonbinary teens
Confusion: 28% of females, 16% of males, and 36% of nonbinary teens
What Are They So Worried About?
- Their Rights

“The election could either help me regain my rights or leave me scared to even leave my house,” says a 17-year-old Black female from Texas. This isn't an isolated sentiment—68% of teens say there's a lot at stake. For example, one 16-year-old Asian male from Colorado fears the election results could lead to his mother's deportation.

- Their Future

For many teens, this election isn't just about politics but their futures. About one-third of them believe it could affect their education and career prospects, with females and nonbinary teens showing heightened anxiety. “I think this election will decide if I can go to college or ever buy a house,” says a 13-year-old White female from Utah. Still, about a quarter of males also consider its impact on their futures. Says one 15-year-old Hispanic male from California, “I'll be turning 18 within the next president's term and their policies will either help or undermine the start of my adult life.”

- Their Safety

As anti-trans legislation continues to be introduced in many states, nonbinary and transgender teens are grappling with existential fears. “This election will literally determine whether it is still safe for me to even exist in this country anymore or not,” says an 18-year-old White nonbinary individual from Virginia. Another safety issue that looms large in teens' minds is school shootings. “With the amount of school shootings in the past 5 to 10 years, gun control is becoming more of a pressing issue,” says a 17-year-old White female from Louisiana.


How's The Country Doing?
We also asked teens about their attitudes about the country and the political climate overall. Most agree that the U.S. is too politically divided (62%); however, their optimism varies based on gender identity. For example, only 42% of teens believe the United States is generally fair and just, but male teens are nearly four times more likely than nonbinary teens to hold this view.

Optimism about the country's direction shows similar gender-based disparities. Males are more likely to believe the country is changing for the better (48%) compared to females (27%) and those of another gender (19%).
Key Takeaways
Teens Feel the Election Has High Stakes: Most teens (51%) believe the election will significantly impact their lives.

Rights & Safety: Personal freedoms and security are top concerns.

Economic Anxiety: Fears about education costs and future opportunities are prevalent.

Gender Shapes Outlook: Male teens show more optimism about America's present and future.

Presidential Election Has Teens on Edge

PUBLISHED DATE: OCTOBER 8, 2024

This report kicks off our election coverage, revealing key findings from our September study on teen political attitudes and behaviors. New insights will be released weekly until Election Day.
Adults aren't the only ones feeling the weight of the upcoming election. Our recent study surveyed 1,783 teenagers and shows that teens are just as tuned in—and stressed out—by what's at stake. While many can't vote yet, their emotions and opinions give insight into the next generation of voters.
High Impact, High Anxiety
A striking 51% of teens rate the election's impact on their future as high” or “extreme.” “The election will have a huge impact on things like climate change and job opportunities, which are really important as I start thinking about my future,” says a 17-year-old White male from California. “It could also change how my generation deals with social issues and technology, shaping our lives in ways we might not fully understand yet.”
What Are Teens Feeling?
Concern: 37% of females, 24% of males, and 51% of nonbinary teens
Anxiety: 29% of females, 16% of males, and 44% of nonbinary teens
Confusion: 28% of females, 16% of males, and 36% of nonbinary teens
What Are They So Worried About?
- Their Rights

“The election could either help me regain my rights or leave me scared to even leave my house,” says a 17-year-old Black female from Texas. This isn't an isolated sentiment—68% of teens say there's a lot at stake. For example, one 16-year-old Asian male from Colorado fears the election results could lead to his mother's deportation.

- Their Future

For many teens, this election isn't just about politics but their futures. About one-third of them believe it could affect their education and career prospects, with females and nonbinary teens showing heightened anxiety. “I think this election will decide if I can go to college or ever buy a house,” says a 13-year-old White female from Utah. Still, about a quarter of males also consider its impact on their futures. Says one 15-year-old Hispanic male from California, “I'll be turning 18 within the next president's term and their policies will either help or undermine the start of my adult life.”

- Their Safety

As anti-trans legislation continues to be introduced in many states, nonbinary and transgender teens are grappling with existential fears. “This election will literally determine whether it is still safe for me to even exist in this country anymore or not,” says an 18-year-old White nonbinary individual from Virginia. Another safety issue that looms large in teens' minds is school shootings. “With the amount of school shootings in the past 5 to 10 years, gun control is becoming more of a pressing issue,” says a 17-year-old White female from Louisiana.


How's The Country Doing?
We also asked teens about their attitudes about the country and the political climate overall. Most agree that the U.S. is too politically divided (62%); however, their optimism varies based on gender identity. For example, only 42% of teens believe the United States is generally fair and just, but male teens are nearly four times more likely than nonbinary teens to hold this view.

Optimism about the country's direction shows similar gender-based disparities. Males are more likely to believe the country is changing for the better (48%) compared to females (27%) and those of another gender (19%).
Key Takeaways
Teens Feel the Election Has High Stakes: Most teens (51%) believe the election will significantly impact their lives.

Rights & Safety: Personal freedoms and security are top concerns.

Economic Anxiety: Fears about education costs and future opportunities are prevalent.

Gender Shapes Outlook: Male teens show more optimism about America's present and future.

Teens and Social Media: How Gen Z Can Help Share Your Message

PUBLISHED DATE: JULY 17, 2024

Teens and social media are intertwined, but their online presence is quieter than you might think. While nearly all teens use social media, over a third rarely post. Understanding teens and social media use is crucial for effective outreach. This article explores social media use among teens, delving into why teens use social media and Gen Z social media trends.

When teens post, it's typically personal content: friends, family, pets, events, and achievements. However, they're more active in sharing content others post, especially if it's interesting, funny, or relevant. Shared content ranges from celebrity gossip to life hacks and humorous videos. Females are significantly more likely to share than males.

Social media use among teens evolves with age. Middle schoolers primarily post and share personal content, with some interest in life hacks. Older teens expand their social media use, posting about broader interests like music, fashion, travel, food, and style and sharing opinions around these topics.

For some, sharing builds community around shared interests. Others see it as a potential income source through affiliate marketing and monetization, aligning with the broader Gen Z social media trends of online entrepreneurship.
Content sharing is key to viral reach. To leverage this, consider these strategies:


Target Females: They are more likely to share content.
Engage Older Teens: They interact with and share broader, non-personal topics.
Leverage Teen Interests: Focus on topics like friends, hobbies, music, and fashion. Find creative ways to connect your message to these interests.
Encourage Interaction: Prioritize genuine conversations over simple "likes."
Offer Monetization Opportunities: Allow teens to earn by sharing content.
Employ Teen Interns: By assigning them content creation and sharing tasks you can engage them in a way that interests them and teaches them how social media can be used in a positive way or even as a potential career.

When targeting teens and social media, remember they're not children. While humor is effective, avoid condescending language or age-inappropriate activities. Respect their intelligence and interests to effectively engage them in sharing your organization's message.

You’ll Be Surprised by These Facts About AI and Teens

PUBLISHED DATE: JULY 17, 2024

Our surveys can help you explore teens' views and concerns about AI, understand its perceived impact on their future, and learn how organizations can address these issues effectively.

You might think that teens would welcome AI with open arms. After all, it’s a lot of fun... it makes it easy to “write” a paper by simply copying an assignment into a prompt. You can use it to invent new music, and even create awesome images of imaginary worlds. Some teens do embrace AI. But a significant majority of teens are worried. More than 90% have thought about the impact of AI, and 64% of teens across all demographics say they are moderately to very worried about its impact. These concerns about AI are widespread among young people.

For the most part, teens share the same AI concerns as their parents. Could AI leave me unemployed? Could I be conned by an AI scam, and wind up losing all my money? Many also have AI privacy concerns, wondering, "Is AI going to steal my face?" These privacy concerns with AI reflect a broader anxiety about data security and online identity. Says one 12th grader,“GenAI will be used in a lot of design and data analysis jobs. It can completely take over some jobs in those areas, though there will still be humans needed to edit the ideas of GenAI. Its presence has made me search for careers that are safe from AI takeover”

Like many older adults, teens worry about AI as a possible existential threat to humanity.

Among the most pressing concerns about AI is its potential impact on human creativity and the job market. Thirty-seven percent of teens worry that AI will make human-generated content unnecessary, thereby eliminating the need for (or potentially even the desire for) creativity. This could mean fewer teens heading for creative careers in areas such as graphic design, writing, film, or even architecture. This shift is a significant ethical concern with AI, raising questions about the value of human creativity in a technologically advanced world.

A third of teens think AI will become self-aware and target humans. The result would presumably be a Terminator-style takeover of the planet by sentient, computer-based beings. Is this a realistic concern? Almost certainly not. But it's a real one. This doomsday scenario appears heavily promoted on social media, with hundreds of YouTube and TikTok videos available on topics such as "How AI Will Destroy Humanity." These fears, while perhaps unfounded, contribute to the overall concerns about AI among young people.


How can marketers and service providers to the teen market respond to this ambivalent feeling about AI? Here are some steps you may consider.

- Avoid using obviously artificially created content on social media. While it's more expensive to hire an illustrator or photographer, your content will appear more trustworthy to the average teen.

- When creating interactive experiences for teens, include a real human face and/or voice—even if you use AI to develop some of those experiences.

- Offer real-world opportunities to get to know you, your offerings, or your products. While teens "live" on social media, they need opportunities to engage in the real world.

- If you work with students using artificial intelligence directly, consider providing opportunities for them to learn more about AI—what it is, what it isn't, what it can offer, and what it might take away. Then, help teens take control over a technology that will, no matter what, significantly impact their futures.

Understanding how teens and students use and don't use AI, addressing ethical concerns with AI, and providing educational resources can empower teens to navigate the complexities of this technology.

Making the Grade: The Academic Goals of High School Students

PUBLISHED DATE: JULY 17, 2024

Our surveys provide insights so you can understand how important grades are to today’s teens, the pressures they face, and how organizations can holistically support student goals.

When we asked teens what was important to them about academics, more than half said it was getting good student grades. Considering that not quite a third of teens said they prioritized balancing their schoolwork with other activities, it’s no wonder that studies are also a significant source of stress for them. Knowing the percentage of high school students who care about grades helps organizations understand the pressures students face.
Doing well in middle and high school lays the foundations for further education after graduation, but that’s not the only reason teens place such importance on good grades. There’s the expectations of parents and guardians, peer pressure, and the positive impact of good grades on their self-esteem. These factors contribute significantly to student priorities and teen goals.

There’s a lot of ground to be covered by organizations that want to help teens achieve their student goals beyond table stakes, like study aids and test preparation. Most teens expect to continue their education after high school and would benefit from help with long-term planning. Many also express concerns about how to parlay their education into a career they want, which can be addressed by providing insights into the job market and requirements of different professions. For those whose plans do not include traditional college, understanding how their current education relates to non-traditional education and career paths would be beneficial. Supporting student priorities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses academic and career aspirations. However, teens also told us there are downsides to the drive for top marks—most importantly, the impact on their well-being.

“I feel like I amount to nothing if I don’t get good grades and it really drains my mental health trying to keep everything perfect.” — 17, Delaware

“I try hard to get good grades in school, but I put my mental health over any grade or test.” — 13, Connecticut

“It really makes me feel stupid when someone else has better grades than me or when I don’t immediately understand something. I’m in all Honors and AP classes, but I don’t feel smart. I have A’s and B’s, but I feel dumb if I get below a 90 on a test, which happens a lot.” — 15, Ohio

These examples are key because, alongside good grades, protecting their mental health is also a priority of teens today. But teens told us that while they know they need support and often know where to find it, they don’t always seek it out. This discrepancy highlights the importance of understanding student priorities and providing support. Organizations looking for ways to help teens academically should consider a holistic approach that includes tools to deal with stress. That could be the key to providing not just a single benefit but a cascade of good outcomes since pursuing academic excellence is interlinked with many other aspects of their lives.

Today’s teens have a complex relationship with the idea of getting good grades. Addressing student grades as a source of stress can positively influence well-being. We know that the report card may be the finish line, but there’s an entire obstacle course between them and it. Helping them navigate those hazards can improve their GPAs and their broader lives. Organizations can create more effective support systems by understanding the percentage of high school students who care about grades and their broader student goals.

Our surveys provide insights so you can understand how important grades are to today’s teens, the pressures they face, and how organizations can holistically support student goals.

When we asked teens what was important to them about academics, more than half said it was getting good student grades. Considering that not quite a third of teens said they prioritized balancing their schoolwork with other activities, it’s no wonder that studies are also a significant source of stress for them. Knowing the percentage of high school students who care about grades helps organizations understand the pressures students face.
Doing well in middle and high school lays the foundations for further education after graduation, but that’s not the only reason teens place such importance on good grades. There’s the expectations of parents and guardians, peer pressure, and the positive impact of good grades on their self-esteem. These factors contribute significantly to student priorities and teen goals.

There’s a lot of ground to be covered by organizations that want to help teens achieve their student goals beyond table stakes, like study aids and test preparation. Most teens expect to continue their education after high school and would benefit from help with long-term planning. Many also express concerns about how to parlay their education into a career they want, which can be addressed by providing insights into the job market and requirements of different professions. For those whose plans do not include traditional college, understanding how their current education relates to non-traditional education and career paths would be beneficial. Supporting student priorities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses academic and career aspirations. However, teens also told us there are downsides to the drive for top marks—most importantly, the impact on their well-being.

“I feel like I amount to nothing if I don’t get good grades and it really drains my mental health trying to keep everything perfect.” — 17, Delaware

“I try hard to get good grades in school, but I put my mental health over any grade or test.” — 13, Connecticut

“It really makes me feel stupid when someone else has better grades than me or when I don’t immediately understand something. I’m in all Honors and AP classes, but I don’t feel smart. I have A’s and B’s, but I feel dumb if I get below a 90 on a test, which happens a lot.” — 15, Ohio

These examples are key because, alongside good grades, protecting their mental health is also a priority of teens today. But teens told us that while they know they need support and often know where to find it, they don’t always seek it out. This discrepancy highlights the importance of understanding student priorities and providing support. Organizations looking for ways to help teens academically should consider a holistic approach that includes tools to deal with stress. That could be the key to providing not just a single benefit but a cascade of good outcomes since pursuing academic excellence is interlinked with many other aspects of their lives.

Today’s teens have a complex relationship with the idea of getting good grades. Addressing student grades as a source of stress can positively influence well-being. We know that the report card may be the finish line, but there’s an entire obstacle course between them and it. Helping them navigate those hazards can improve their GPAs and their broader lives. Organizations can create more effective support systems by understanding the percentage of high school students who care about grades and their broader student goals.

Saving to Spend: Teens and Finance

PUBLISHED DATE: JULY 17, 2024

Today’s teens (Gen Z) know they need money in the future, and many worry about their financial stability. However, when it comes to money management , they can be a bit impulsive.

Most teens report managing their money, with two-thirds saving money in savings accounts. However, fewer are budgeting, tracking spending, or learning about essential teen financial literacy topics like taxes and funding higher education.


When examining why teens are saving money, a short-term focus emerges. The most common reason is simply to have savings, though only 40% of teens gave this response.

Understanding what Gen Z spends their money on reveals a preference for immediate gratification. Common savings goals include education, hobbies, cars, clothing, beauty products, gaming, travel, and entertainment. Gen Z investing and saving for housing are less frequent priorities.

Despite this, teens express interest in improving their long-term financial knowledge. Half admit worrying about their future financial stability—a significant concern given their experience with economic instability during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic challenges. This generation lacks the financial optimism of previous generations.

These concerns present a key opportunity to boost teen financial literacy and encourage positive financial habits. While teens and finance may seem like an odd couple, their existing saving habits offer a starting point. By linking saving to long-term goals, organizations can help teens transition from simply saving money to saving with a purpose.

Engaging teens requires interactive methods. Gamification, simulations involving hobbies, and challenges tied to personal goals (like education and career) can make learning about finance more appealing. This approach can cultivate a generation that not only saves, but saves purposefully, transforming current Gen Z spending habits into financially responsible behaviors.

How Teens Are Using (and Not Using) Generative AI

PUBLISHED DATE: JULY 16, 2024

AI is everywhere in the business world, but it’s just getting started for teens. Yes, 81% of teens have heard of at least one of the top AI tools, but only 41% have heard of ChatGPT, the leading AI tool on the market. That number is much lower for other AI tools like Gemini or DALL-E.

And surprisingly, you will only find a small number of students using AI tools. Forty percent of students using artificial intelligence have tried ChatGPT, 17% have tried Gemini, and far fewer have tried any other option. This means that current data shows the answer to the question of how many students use AI is relatively few.

But whether they’re using it or not, AI will become an increasingly important part of teens’ lives, so important that they become familiar with what AI can and can’t do. Learning how students use AI in school will give us clues as to how they will use it in the future.
So far, students using AI are trying it out for homework, schoolwork, and related activities like writing and tutoring. A minority of people are starting to use AI for creative visual art and finding things to do. Fifteen percent say they’re using AI to “keep them company,” which may involve chatting with AI bots such as Alexa or Siri to pass the time.

That means that only a tiny number of teens are exploring the “fun” side of AI – nor are they truly exploiting its ability to help with problem-solving or exploration. Only a few said they’d explored future options, made plans, learned about new hobbies, built personal skills, or asked AI for advice about anything – from fashion to travel planning. In fact, 25% of teens say they’ve never used AI – for any purpose.

Parents may be pleased to hear that AI isn’t a significant part of teens’ day-to-day lives. But if they’ve perused job listings recently, they may be surprised to see how many job descriptions include at least a mention of AI use. And AI is a growing part of many things teens enjoy, from video games to television to music.

Now is the right time to develop tools, courses, and experiences to give teens the tools they need to use AI appropriately, effectively, and creatively. Such offerings are a vital part of providing today’s young people with tools for –


Using AI to explore post-secondary options
Tapping into AI’s ability to expand on and explore creative ideas
Understanding real-world examples of how various careers use AI.
Evaluating products produced by AI for issues ranging from bias to accuracy
Defining appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in various settings

Rather than allowing teens to avoid AI altogether, it will be essential to build their experience, confidence, and critical skills so that they can incorporate AI into their lives and their work. By understanding how students can use AI in school today, you can help them navigate the future of work and life.

COMMERCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Acceptance of These Commercial Terms and Conditions

These commercial terms and conditions (collectively, the “Commercial Terms”) are an agreement between you and NextGen Insights Group LLC dba TeenVoice (“TeenVoice”, “we”, or “us”). These Commercial Terms govern your access to and use of our website at www.teenvoice.com (the “Site”) and the services, content, and functionality made available on or through the Site (the “Services”), whether you are a guest or registered or unregistered user. As used in these Commercial Terms, the “Services” include all of their pages, functionality, and features, and all publications and other services, content, information, links, and other materials (collectively, “Materials”) made available on or through the Services. As used in these Commercial Terms, the “Services” do not include any services, videos, content, information, links, or other materials offered on or through third-party websites or otherwise by third parties (“Third-Party Services”) or any Survey Questions or other User Content (each as defined below).

All personal information that we may collect on or through the Services, including personal information you provide to register with the Services and personal information collected by us through or in connection with your use of any features of the Services, is subject to our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”). By using the Services, you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your personal information in compliance with the Privacy Policy. To the extent you receive de-identified information as part of the Services, you agree to use such information only in de-identified form and not attempt to reidentify individuals on the basis of such information.

Please read these Commercial Terms and the Privacy Policy carefully before you start to use the Services. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE “ARBITRATION” SECTION OF THESE COMMERCIAL TERMS CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH TEENVOICE AND PROVIDERS (AS DEFINED BELOW).

By accessing or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by and comply with these Commercial Terms and acknowledge that you have read and understand our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Commercial Terms, or if you object to the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Services.

The Services are offered and available only to users who (i) are using the Services on behalf of a business, whether incorporated or not, and (ii) are at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction, if greater. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you (a) are at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, if greater, (b) are fully able and competent to enter into, and to abide by and comply with, these Commercial Terms, and (c) have not previously been terminated, removed, or suspended from the Services. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you further represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to these Commercial Terms, and you agree to be bound by these Commercial Terms on behalf of that entity. For the avoidance of doubt, if you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, the terms “you” and “your” will include such entity.

Our Services utilize certain third-party services and link to Third-Party Services. Except as otherwise disclosed in our Privacy Policy, your access to Third-Party Services, whether or not initiated through the Services, is subject to the terms of service, privacy policies, and other terms and conditions of such Third-Party Services, as applicable, and you should be sure that you have read and understand such terms of service, privacy policies, and other terms and conditions. If the Services contain links to other websites or to Third-Party Services, these links are provided for your convenience only. This includes links contained in advertisements, including banner advertisements and sponsored links. We do not control the Third-Party Services and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to the Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to any terms of use, privacy policies, or other terms and conditions for such third-party websites.

As between you and us, these Commercial Terms are effective from the first moment you access the Services and will remain effective thereafter in perpetuity, unless terminated earlier as provided hereinafter.

Changes to These Commercial Terms

We may revise and/or update these Commercial Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all of your access to and use of the Services thereafter. If you continue to use the Services after we post the revised and/or updated Commercial Terms, it means that you accept and agree to the revisions and/or updates. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. The date these Commercial Terms were last revised and/or updated is identified at the top of this page.

Accessing the Services and Account Security

To access the Services or any Third-Party Services made available on or through the Services, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide on the Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree that we may use this information to communicate with you about the Services and that our communications to you will satisfy any requirements for legal notices.

You are responsible for both:

Making all arrangements (including obtaining any internet connection) necessary for you to have access to the Services; and
Ensuring that all persons who access or use the Services through your account agree to these Commercial Terms and comply with them.

You acknowledge that your account is personal to you. If you choose or are provided with a user name, a password, or any other information as part of our security procedures, you must keep that information confidential and not disclose it to any other person or entity. You may not provide any other person with access to the Services or portions of them using your user name, password, or other security information. You are responsible for all activity occurring under your account or with use of your user name and password.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. You may report unauthorized access by sending an email to support@teenvoice.com.

We have the right to disable any user name, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion.

Billing

You may be required to pay fees (which may include any applicable taxes) to TeenVoice to access or use the Services or any Materials (“Fees”). Fee payments are processed in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying any Fees listed in connection with the Services or any Materials (which may require advance payment of Fees). Except as expressly provided in these Commercial Terms, all Fees are non-refundable to the extent allowed under applicable law.

With respect to the payment method that you specify at the time of your purchase (the “Payment Method”), you expressly agree that TeenVoice is authorized to charge the Fees (which may include any applicable taxes) to the Payment Method. If the Payment Method is a credit card, you acknowledge that TeenVoice may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit to complete the purchase. You represent and warrant that the credit card or bank account which is being used as your Payment Method is yours or that you have the authorization of the account holder to use it. If you use a Payment Method which you are not authorized to use, you will be liable to us for any losses that we suffer as a result of your use of that Payment Method.

You acknowledge and agree that TeenVoice may use third-party payment processors to process Fees and perform related services on TeenVoice’s behalf and that TeenVoice will not be liable for any errors caused by such third-party payment processors.

You acknowledge and agree that Fees for the Services and Materials may increase at any time, and additional Fees may apply to new features or additions to the Services or any Materials that may be made available from time to time. TeenVoice will provide you with notice before charging increased or additional Fees, and you will have an opportunity to review and accept the increased or additional Fees that you will be charged before being charged. If you do not accept any such increased or additional Fees, TeenVoice may discontinue your access to the Services or Materials.

TeenVoice will not provide any refunds for Surveys that you cancel. If you cancel a Survey, then TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, provide you with credits that you can apply to payment for other Surveys. Any such credits may be based on the quantity of responses to the Survey at the time of cancelation, the length of time that the Survey was made available to Survey Respondents before cancelation, or other factors as determined by TeenVoice in its sole discretion.

If you feel you have been charged any Fees in error, you may contact us directly at payments@teenvoice.com. Following your request, you will be asked to provide the reason for your request. We aim to respond to such requests within three business days of our receipt of such requests. We note that if you file a dispute with your credit card company before contacting us, we are limited in what we can do to resolve any error. Credit card disputes are flagged to us by your financial services provider as potentially fraudulent, so if a credit card dispute is initiated, your account may be suspended while we investigate, and we ask you to contact us if you wish to request that it be reinstated.

Prohibited Uses

You may use the Services only for your own internal purposes and in accordance with these Commercial Terms and applicable law. Any use of the Services or the Materials in a way not expressly permitted by these Commercial Terms is a breach of these Commercial Terms. In addition to any other prohibitions stated in these Commercial Terms, you agree not to use the Services or any Materials:

In any way that violates applicable law (including any fraudulent conduct or any conduct that violates any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other countries);
For the purpose of exploiting, harming, or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personal information, or otherwise;

To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone’s use or enjoyment of the Services, or which, as determined by us in our sole discretion, may harm TeenVoice or users of the Services, or expose us or them to liability.

Additionally, you agree not to:

Use the Services in any manner that could disable, overburden, damage, or impair the Services or interfere with or otherwise inhibit any other person’s or entity’s access to or use of the Services, including their ability to engage in real-time activities through the Services;
Use any robot, spider, or other automatic device, process, or means to access the Services for any purpose, including monitoring, scraping, or copying any of the Services’ Materials;

Attack the Services via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of-service attack; or
Otherwise attempt to interfere with or inhibit the proper working of the Services.
User Content; Surveys

The Services may contain interactive features that allow users to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit (“post”) surveys to be completed by teenagers (such surveys, “Surveys”, and such teenagers, “Survey Respondents”) and other content (such Surveys and other content, collectively, “User Content”) on or through the Services. If the Services permit you to create Surveys, you may create a Survey by posting to TeenVoice survey questions (“Survey Questions”), which may concern demographic information about the Survey Respondents completing the surveys (“Demographic Questions”) or may concern other content (“Other Questions”). For the avoidance of doubt, Survey Questions will be deemed your User Content.

With respect to Surveys, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, review and suggest changes to the Survey Questions or other User Content that you post, and TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, condition approval of any or all such Survey Questions or User Content on your acceptance of such suggested changes;
Although the Services may permit you to designate timelines applicable to Surveys, including timelines during which Survey Respondents may respond to your Survey, TeenVoice will not be liable for any failure to meet such timelines;
TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, review and screen Survey Respondents’ responses to your Survey before TeenVoice makes any such responses available to you, including to remove personally-identifying information and responses that are not authentic or are otherwise inappropriate; and
You will not receive or have access to raw responses to Surveys, and you will only be provided with responses to Surveys that TeenVoice has screened as described herein (such screened responses, “Survey Responses”).

All User Content must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Commercial Terms.

By providing any User Content on or through the Services, you grant us and our affiliates and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such User Content to make the Surveys available to Survey Respondents, make the Services and Materials and any Third-Party Services available to you and other users of the Services, develop and improve the Services and other products and services, and for any other purpose.

You represent and warrant that:

You own or control all rights in and to your User Content and have the right to grant the license granted above to us and our affiliates, partners, and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns; and
All of your User Content does and will comply with these Commercial Terms (including the Content Standards).

You understand and acknowledge that:

You are responsible for any User Content you post, submit, publish, display, or transmit, and you, not TeenVoice, have full responsibility for such User Content, including the legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness of such User Content;
We will not be responsible or liable to you or any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Content posted by you or any other user of the Services or for any loss or unavailability of your User Content; and
Your User Content may not be treated as confidential, including by TeenVoice making your Survey Questions available to Survey Respondents.

As between TeenVoice and you, TeenVoice owns all right, title, and interest in and to any Survey Responses for the Demographic Questions. As between TeenVoice and you, you own all right, title, and interest in and to any Survey Responses for the Other Questions; TeenVoice hereby assigns to you any right, title, or interest that it may have in or to any Survey Responses for the Other Questions; and you hereby grant to TeenVoice a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such Survey Responses for any purpose.

In addition to, and without limiting, any disclaimers set forth in the “Disclaimer of Warranties” Section below, TeenVoice makes no representations or warranties regarding whether Survey Respondents will complete any Surveys, whether you will receive an adequate quantity of Survey Responses within any specific timeframe, or whether Survey Responses will otherwise meet your needs or expectations. In addition to, and without limiting, the “Limitation on Liability” Section below, to the fullest extent provided by law, in no event will TeenVoice be liable in connection with your use of, or inability to use, or reliance on or actions or inaction based on any Surveys or any Survey Responses.

Content Standards

The following content standards (the “Content Standards”) apply to any and all User Content. User Content must in its entirety comply with all applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, User Content must not:

Contain any material that is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable;
Contain, exhibit, or promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age;

Infringe or misappropriate any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any other person or entity;
Violate the legal rights (including the rights of publicity and privacy) of others or contain any material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable law or that otherwise may be in conflict with these Commercial Terms or our Privacy Policy;

Monitoring and Enforcement

We have the right to:

Remove or refuse to post any User Content, including by removing or refusing to include any Survey Question from or in a Survey, for any or no reason in our sole discretion;
Take any action with respect to any User Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Content violates the Commercial Terms, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services, users of TeenVoice’s or its affiliates’ other platforms, or the public, or could create liability for TeenVoice;
Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that information, content, or other material posted, submitted, published, displayed, or transmitted on or through the Services by you violates such third party’s rights, including such third party’s intellectual property rights or their right of publicity or privacy;
Take appropriate legal action, including referral to law enforcement, for any fraudulent or other illegal or unauthorized use of the Services;
Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Services for any or no reason, including any fraudulent or other illegal conduct or violation of these Commercial Terms; or

Feedback

You hereby grant to TeenVoice an irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual license to use all feedback, ideas, or suggested improvements you provide to TeenVoice regarding the Services (collectively, “Feedback”), as applicable, including in connection with TeenVoice’s development and marketing of the Services or other products or services. You further agree that TeenVoice and Providers may use all or part of your Feedback or any derivative thereof in any manner or media without any remuneration, compensation, or credit to you, including to improve the Services and create other products and services.

Modification, Suspension, and Discontinuation of the Services

We may permanently or temporarily modify or remove the Services and any Materials, or any portion thereof, including any links to Third-Party Services, from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, we will not be liable for any modification or removal, or unavailability, of the Services or any portion thereof. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Services, or entire Services, to all users or particular users, without notice, in our sole discretion. Any of the Services or any Materials may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such Services or Materials.

Reliance on Information Posted

The information presented on or through the Services (including information presented on or through any Materials or Third-Party Services) is made available solely for general information purposes. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such information by you or any other visitor to the Services, or by anyone who may be informed of such information.

The Services may include Third-Party Services from or provided by third parties, including third-party partners, licensors, syndicators, aggregators, and/or reporting services. All statements and/or opinions expressed in these Third-Party Services are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity providing those Third-Party Services. These Third-Party Services do not necessarily reflect the opinions of TeenVoice. We expressly disclaim all liability, and we are not responsible or liable to you or any third party, for the content or accuracy of any Third-Party Services

Termination

TeenVoice may terminate these Commercial Terms at any time, for any reason or for no reason, by notice to you, and these Commercial Terms will terminate automatically without notice upon your breach of any provisions of these Commercial Terms. You may also terminate these Commercial Terms at any time, for any reason, by discontinuing your access to and use of the Services. Upon termination, the rights granted to you under these Commercial Terms to access and use the Services will immediately terminate.

Upon termination of these Commercial Terms or your access to the Services, TeenVoice may at its option delete any data associated with your account.

Arbitration

PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS “ARBITRATION” SECTION IS APPLICABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. You and TeenVoice each agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof or the use of the Services (each, a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration, unless expressly provided otherwise in this “Arbitration” Section, and not in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. You and TeenVoice agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Commercial Terms and that EACH OF YOU AND TEENVOICE IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. This “Arbitration” Section shall survive the termination of these Commercial Terms.
Exceptions and Opt-out Option. The only exceptions to this “Arbitration” Section are the following:
You or TeenVoice each may seek to resolve an individual Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
you or TeenVoice each may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of your or TeenVoice’s respective intellectual property rights.
you may opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute individually if you provide us with a signed, written notice of your decision to do so pursuant to the “Effect of Changes on Arbitration” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section below; however, if you are opting out of an updated version of this arbitration provision, you understand that you will remain subject to the prior version of any arbitration provision to which you had previously agreed.
Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification. You and TeenVoice agree that, prior to initiating an arbitration or other legal proceeding, you and TeenVoice will attempt to negotiate an informal resolution of the Dispute. To begin this process, and before initiating any arbitration or legal proceeding against TeenVoice, you must send a Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) by certified mail to the attention of TeenVoice’s Legal Department at the following address: 33 Arch Street, Suite 2100, Boston, MA 02110. For purposes of these Commercial Terms, initiating an arbitration means filing an arbitration demand (“Demand”).

Your Notice to TeenVoice must contain all of the following information: (i) your full name, address, account, and the email address associated with your account; (ii) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (iii) a description of the relief you want, including any money damages you request; and (iv) your signature verifying the accuracy of the Notice and, if you are represented by counsel, authorizing TeenVoice to disclose information about you to your attorney.

After receipt of your Notice, you and TeenVoice shall engage in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days, which both sides may extend by written agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Period”). During the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, neither you nor TeenVoice may initiate an arbitration or other legal proceeding.

If the Dispute is not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, you may initiate an individual arbitration as provided below.

Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. Any arbitration must be initiated with and conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) pursuant to its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (together, the “NAM Rules”), except as modified by these Commercial Terms. The NAM Rules are available at www.NAMADR.org or by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550. In any instance where the applicable NAM Rules and these Commercial Terms are inconsistent, these Commercial Terms shall control.

An arbitration Demand filed with NAM must include a certification signed by the filing party verifying compliance with the Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification requirements and other requirements set out in this “Arbitration” Section.

If NAM fails or declines to conduct the arbitration for any reason, we will mutually select a different arbitration administrator. If we cannot agree, a court will appoint the arbitration administrator.

Any arbitration hearing will be a virtual hearing, unless you and TeenVoice agree otherwise in writing.

The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement, except that only a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in the “Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction” subsection of the “Miscellaneous” Section of these Commercial Terms (and not an arbitrator) shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver set forth in these Commercial Terms or the Mass Filing procedures set forth in the “Mass Filing Procedures” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section below are unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable.

The arbitrator may consider but will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations where you and TeenVoice were not both parties.

Mass Filing Procedures. YOU AND TEENVOICE AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF YOU AND TEENVOICE IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A MASS ARBITRATION. TeenVoice’s receipt of one or more Notice(s) of substantially similar claims brought by or on behalf of 25 or more claimants (including you) within a 60-day period (“Mass Filing”) shall be subject to the additional procedures set forth below. Claims included in a Mass Filing, if not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, may proceed only in accordance with the procedures set out below, and subject to the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM Mass Filing Rules”, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/) to the extent not contrary to these Commercial Terms. If a court determines that this “Mass Filing Procedures” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section is not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim may only proceed individually in court consistent with these Commercial Terms.
Batching. You and TeenVoice agree that your and other individuals’ claims deemed by TeenVoice a Mass Filing may be filed with NAM in batches of no greater than 50 individuals’ claims at one time, with 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by counsel for you and other claimants and 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by TeenVoice. After your claim is batched and permitted to be filed as a Demand, you and TeenVoice agree that selection and appointment of an arbitrator for your Demand shall be governed by the NAM Mass Filing Rules.
First (Bellwether) Batch. The first batch of up to 50 Demands are the Bellwether Arbitrations. If your claim is included in the Bellwether Arbitrations, you and TeenVoice shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.
Stay of Filing of Other Claims. If your claim is not among those selected for the Bellwether Arbitrations, your claim cannot be filed until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed in a later stage of this process. No arbitration fees will be assessed on you or TeenVoice in connection with your claim unless and until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed with NAM.
Mediation. After the Bellwether Arbitrations are completed, if your claim remains unresolved, you and TeenVoice agree to mediate your claim along with any other unresolved claims included in the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”). The mediator will be selected according to the procedure set forth in the NAM Rules, and TeenVoice will pay the mediator’s fees. The Global Mediation shall be completed within 120 days of the selection of a mediator, unless extended by written agreement between you and TeenVoice.
Election To Proceed in Court. If Global Mediation is not successful in resolving your claim, and 100 or more claims included in the Mass Filing remain unresolved, you or TeenVoice may opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim resolved in court consistent with the “Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction” subsection of the “Miscellaneous” Section of these Commercial Terms. You or TeenVoice must exercise this election within 45 days of the completion of Global Mediation.
Sequential Arbitration of Remaining Batches. If neither you nor TeenVoice opt out of arbitration, another batch of no greater than 50 individuals’ claims will be selected from the Mass Filing, with 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by counsel for claimants and 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by TeenVoice. If your claim is included in this next batch of 50 claims, your claim will be filed with NAM, and you and TeenVoice shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference. The process of batching up to 50 individual claims at a time will continue until the parties resolve all claims included in the Mass Filing. No unbatched claim can proceed to be filed as a Demand until the previous batch has been resolved.
Tolling. For any claim subject to these Mass Filing procedures, any statute of limitations applicable to your claim shall be tolled from the date the Informal Dispute Resolution Period begins until the earlier of (i) the date your arbitration Demand is filed, or (ii) the date you or TeenVoice opts out of arbitration pursuant to the “Election to Proceed in Court” subsection of the “Mass Filing Procedures” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section.
Arbitration Costs. Payment of all arbitration filing fees and costs will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules. If you prevail on your claim in arbitration, TeenVoice will reimburse you for any portion of the arbitration filing fees you paid that exceeded the amount you would have paid to file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the “Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction” subsection of the “Miscellaneous” Section. If TeenVoice prevails on your claim in arbitration, and the arbitrator finds that your claim was frivolous or filed in bad faith, the arbitrator may award TeenVoice reimbursement from you of TeenVoice’s arbitration filing fees and costs.
Offer of Settlement. Each of you and TeenVoice may, but is not obligated to, make a written offer to settle your claim at least 14 days before the arbitration hearing date. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If an award is issued in a party’s favor but is less than the other party’s settlement offer, the arbitrator may order such party to pay the arbitration costs incurred by such other party after its offer was made, unless otherwise prohibited by the underlying law governing your claim.
Class Action Waiver. YOU AND TEENVOICE AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF YOU AND TEENVOICE MAY BRING CLAIMS (WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLAIMANT, OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. This also means that you and TeenVoice may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, coordinated, private attorney general, request for public injunctive relief, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding this provision or any other language in these Commercial Terms, you or TeenVoice may participate in a class-wide settlement. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND TEENVOICE WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to These Commercial Terms” Section, if TeenVoice modifies any terms of this “Arbitration” Section after the date you first accepted these Commercial Terms or any subsequent changes to these Commercial Terms, you may reject the new changes to this “Arbitration” Section by sending us written notice, personally signed by you, by certified mail to the attention of TeenVoice’s Legal Department at the at the following address within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the “Last Modified” date of the Commercial Terms you seek to reject: 33 Arch Street, Suite 2100, Boston, MA 02110. Even if you reject a change, you will remain subject to this “Arbitration” Section of the last version of the Commercial Terms you had accepted.
Severability. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this “Arbitration” Section unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then you and TeenVoice agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies; all other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this “Arbitration” Section, and all other Commercial Terms shall continue to be enforceable and valid.
Third-Party Beneficiaries. All TeenVoice Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of this “Arbitration” Section.

You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. The date these Commercial Terms were last revised and/or updated is identified at the top of this page.

Accessing the Services and Account Security

To access the Services or any Third-Party Services made available on or through the Services, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide on the Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree that we may use this information to communicate with you about the Services and that our communications to you will satisfy any requirements for legal notices.

You are responsible for both:

Making all arrangements (including obtaining any internet connection) necessary for you to have access to the Services; and
Ensuring that all persons who access or use the Services through your account agree to these Commercial Terms and comply with them.

You acknowledge that your account is personal to you. If you choose or are provided with a user name, a password, or any other information as part of our security procedures, you must keep that information confidential and not disclose it to any other person or entity. You may not provide any other person with access to the Services or portions of them using your user name, password, or other security information. You are responsible for all activity occurring under your account or with use of your user name and password.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. You may report unauthorized access by sending an email to support@teenvoice.com.

We have the right to disable any user name, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion.

Billing

You may be required to pay fees (which may include any applicable taxes) to TeenVoice to access or use the Services or any Materials (“Fees”). Fee payments are processed in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying any Fees listed in connection with the Services or any Materials (which may require advance payment of Fees). Except as expressly provided in these Commercial Terms, all Fees are non-refundable to the extent allowed under applicable law.

With respect to the payment method that you specify at the time of your purchase (the “Payment Method”), you expressly agree that TeenVoice is authorized to charge the Fees (which may include any applicable taxes) to the Payment Method. If the Payment Method is a credit card, you acknowledge that TeenVoice may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit to complete the purchase. You represent and warrant that the credit card or bank account which is being used as your Payment Method is yours or that you have the authorization of the account holder to use it. If you use a Payment Method which you are not authorized to use, you will be liable to us for any losses that we suffer as a result of your use of that Payment Method.

You acknowledge and agree that TeenVoice may use third-party payment processors to process Fees and perform related services on TeenVoice’s behalf and that TeenVoice will not be liable for any errors caused by such third-party payment processors.

You acknowledge and agree that Fees for the Services and Materials may increase at any time, and additional Fees may apply to new features or additions to the Services or any Materials that may be made available from time to time. TeenVoice will provide you with notice before charging increased or additional Fees, and you will have an opportunity to review and accept the increased or additional Fees that you will be charged before being charged. If you do not accept any such increased or additional Fees, TeenVoice may discontinue your access to the Services or Materials.

TeenVoice will not provide any refunds for Surveys that you cancel. If you cancel a Survey, then TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, provide you with credits that you can apply to payment for other Surveys. Any such credits may be based on the quantity of responses to the Survey at the time of cancelation, the length of time that the Survey was made available to Survey Respondents before cancelation, or other factors as determined by TeenVoice in its sole discretion.

If you feel you have been charged any Fees in error, you may contact us directly at payments@teenvoice.com. Following your request, you will be asked to provide the reason for your request. We aim to respond to such requests within three business days of our receipt of such requests. We note that if you file a dispute with your credit card company before contacting us, we are limited in what we can do to resolve any error. Credit card disputes are flagged to us by your financial services provider as potentially fraudulent, so if a credit card dispute is initiated, your account may be suspended while we investigate, and we ask you to contact us if you wish to request that it be reinstated.

User Content; Surveys

The Services may contain interactive features that allow users to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit (“post”) surveys to be completed by teenagers (such surveys, “Surveys”, and such teenagers, “Survey Respondents”) and other content (such Surveys and other content, collectively, “User Content”) on or through the Services. If the Services permit you to create Surveys, you may create a Survey by posting to TeenVoice survey questions (“Survey Questions”), which may concern demographic information about the Survey Respondents completing the surveys (“Demographic Questions”) or may concern other content (“Other Questions”). For the avoidance of doubt, Survey Questions will be deemed your User Content.

With respect to Surveys, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, review and suggest changes to the Survey Questions or other User Content that you post, and TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, condition approval of any or all such Survey Questions or User Content on your acceptance of such suggested changes;
Although the Services may permit you to designate timelines applicable to Surveys, including timelines during which Survey Respondents may respond to your Survey, TeenVoice will not be liable for any failure to meet such timelines;
TeenVoice may, in its sole discretion, review and screen Survey Respondents’ responses to your Survey before TeenVoice makes any such responses available to you, including to remove personally-identifying information and responses that are not authentic or are otherwise inappropriate; and
You will not receive or have access to raw responses to Surveys, and you will only be provided with responses to Surveys that TeenVoice has screened as described herein (such screened responses, “Survey Responses”).

All User Content must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Commercial Terms.

By providing any User Content on or through the Services, you grant us and our affiliates and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such User Content to make the Surveys available to Survey Respondents, make the Services and Materials and any Third-Party Services available to you and other users of the Services, develop and improve the Services and other products and services, and for any other purpose.

You represent and warrant that:

You own or control all rights in and to your User Content and have the right to grant the license granted above to us and our affiliates, partners, and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns; and
All of your User Content does and will comply with these Commercial Terms (including the Content Standards).

You understand and acknowledge that:

You are responsible for any User Content you post, submit, publish, display, or transmit, and you, not TeenVoice, have full responsibility for such User Content, including the legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness of such User Content;
We will not be responsible or liable to you or any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Content posted by you or any other user of the Services or for any loss or unavailability of your User Content; and
Your User Content may not be treated as confidential, including by TeenVoice making your Survey Questions available to Survey Respondents.

As between TeenVoice and you, TeenVoice owns all right, title, and interest in and to any Survey Responses for the Demographic Questions. As between TeenVoice and you, you own all right, title, and interest in and to any Survey Responses for the Other Questions; TeenVoice hereby assigns to you any right, title, or interest that it may have in or to any Survey Responses for the Other Questions; and you hereby grant to TeenVoice a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such Survey Responses for any purpose.

In addition to, and without limiting, any disclaimers set forth in the “Disclaimer of Warranties” Section below, TeenVoice makes no representations or warranties regarding whether Survey Respondents will complete any Surveys, whether you will receive an adequate quantity of Survey Responses within any specific timeframe, or whether Survey Responses will otherwise meet your needs or expectations. In addition to, and without limiting, the “Limitation on Liability” Section below, to the fullest extent provided by law, in no event will TeenVoice be liable in connection with your use of, or inability to use, or reliance on or actions or inaction based on any Surveys or any Survey Responses.

Content Standards

Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that information, content, or other material posted, submitted, published, displayed, or transmitted on or through the Services by you violates such third party’s rights, including such third party’s intellectual property rights or their right of publicity or privacy;

Arbitration

PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS “ARBITRATION” SECTION IS APPLICABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. You and TeenVoice each agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof or the use of the Services (each, a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration, unless expressly provided otherwise in this “Arbitration” Section, and not in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. You and TeenVoice agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Commercial Terms and that EACH OF YOU AND TEENVOICE IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. This “Arbitration” Section shall survive the termination of these Commercial Terms.
Exceptions and Opt-out Option. The only exceptions to this “Arbitration” Section are the following:
You or TeenVoice each may seek to resolve an individual Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
you or TeenVoice each may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of your or TeenVoice’s respective intellectual property rights.
you may opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute individually if you provide us with a signed, written notice of your decision to do so pursuant to the “Effect of Changes on Arbitration” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section below; however, if you are opting out of an updated version of this arbitration provision, you understand that you will remain subject to the prior version of any arbitration provision to which you had previously agreed.
Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification. You and TeenVoice agree that, prior to initiating an arbitration or other legal proceeding, you and TeenVoice will attempt to negotiate an informal resolution of the Dispute. To begin this process, and before initiating any arbitration or legal proceeding against TeenVoice, you must send a Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) by certified mail to the attention of TeenVoice’s Legal Department at the following address: 33 Arch Street, Suite 2100, Boston, MA 02110. For purposes of these Commercial Terms, initiating an arbitration means filing an arbitration demand (“Demand”).

Your Notice to TeenVoice must contain all of the following information: (i) your full name, address, account, and the email address associated with your account; (ii) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (iii) a description of the relief you want, including any money damages you request; and (iv) your signature verifying the accuracy of the Notice and, if you are represented by counsel, authorizing TeenVoice to disclose information about you to your attorney.

After receipt of your Notice, you and TeenVoice shall engage in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days, which both sides may extend by written agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Period”). During the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, neither you nor TeenVoice may initiate an arbitration or other legal proceeding.

If the Dispute is not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, you may initiate an individual arbitration as provided below.

Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. Any arbitration must be initiated with and conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) pursuant to its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (together, the “NAM Rules”), except as modified by these Commercial Terms. The NAM Rules are available at www.NAMADR.org or by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550. In any instance where the applicable NAM Rules and these Commercial Terms are inconsistent, these Commercial Terms shall control.

An arbitration Demand filed with NAM must include a certification signed by the filing party verifying compliance with the Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification requirements and other requirements set out in this “Arbitration” Section.

If NAM fails or declines to conduct the arbitration for any reason, we will mutually select a different arbitration administrator. If we cannot agree, a court will appoint the arbitration administrator.

Any arbitration hearing will be a virtual hearing, unless you and TeenVoice agree otherwise in writing.

The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement, except that only a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in the “Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction” subsection of the “Miscellaneous” Section of these Commercial Terms (and not an arbitrator) shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver set forth in these Commercial Terms or the Mass Filing procedures set forth in the “Mass Filing Procedures” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section below are unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable.

The arbitrator may consider but will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations where you and TeenVoice were not both parties.

Mass Filing Procedures. YOU AND TEENVOICE AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF YOU AND TEENVOICE IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A MASS ARBITRATION. TeenVoice’s receipt of one or more Notice(s) of substantially similar claims brought by or on behalf of 25 or more claimants (including you) within a 60-day period (“Mass Filing”) shall be subject to the additional procedures set forth below. Claims included in a Mass Filing, if not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, may proceed only in accordance with the procedures set out below, and subject to the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM Mass Filing Rules”, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/) to the extent not contrary to these Commercial Terms. If a court determines that this “Mass Filing Procedures” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section is not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim may only proceed individually in court consistent with these Commercial Terms.
Batching. You and TeenVoice agree that your and other individuals’ claims deemed by TeenVoice a Mass Filing may be filed with NAM in batches of no greater than 50 individuals’ claims at one time, with 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by counsel for you and other claimants and 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by TeenVoice. After your claim is batched and permitted to be filed as a Demand, you and TeenVoice agree that selection and appointment of an arbitrator for your Demand shall be governed by the NAM Mass Filing Rules.
First (Bellwether) Batch. The first batch of up to 50 Demands are the Bellwether Arbitrations. If your claim is included in the Bellwether Arbitrations, you and TeenVoice shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.
Stay of Filing of Other Claims. If your claim is not among those selected for the Bellwether Arbitrations, your claim cannot be filed until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed in a later stage of this process. No arbitration fees will be assessed on you or TeenVoice in connection with your claim unless and until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed with NAM.
Mediation. After the Bellwether Arbitrations are completed, if your claim remains unresolved, you and TeenVoice agree to mediate your claim along with any other unresolved claims included in the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”). The mediator will be selected according to the procedure set forth in the NAM Rules, and TeenVoice will pay the mediator’s fees. The Global Mediation shall be completed within 120 days of the selection of a mediator, unless extended by written agreement between you and TeenVoice.
Election To Proceed in Court. If Global Mediation is not successful in resolving your claim, and 100 or more claims included in the Mass Filing remain unresolved, you or TeenVoice may opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim resolved in court consistent with the “Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction” subsection of the “Miscellaneous” Section of these Commercial Terms. You or TeenVoice must exercise this election within 45 days of the completion of Global Mediation.
Sequential Arbitration of Remaining Batches. If neither you nor TeenVoice opt out of arbitration, another batch of no greater than 50 individuals’ claims will be selected from the Mass Filing, with 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by counsel for claimants and 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by TeenVoice. If your claim is included in this next batch of 50 claims, your claim will be filed with NAM, and you and TeenVoice shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference. The process of batching up to 50 individual claims at a time will continue until the parties resolve all claims included in the Mass Filing. No unbatched claim can proceed to be filed as a Demand until the previous batch has been resolved.
Tolling. For any claim subject to these Mass Filing procedures, any statute of limitations applicable to your claim shall be tolled from the date the Informal Dispute Resolution Period begins until the earlier of (i) the date your arbitration Demand is filed, or (ii) the date you or TeenVoice opts out of arbitration pursuant to the “Election to Proceed in Court” subsection of the “Mass Filing Procedures” subsection of this “Arbitration” Section.
Arbitration Costs. Payment of all arbitration filing fees and costs will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules. If you prevail on your claim in arbitration, TeenVoice will reimburse you for any portion of the arbitration filing fees you paid that exceeded the amount you would have paid to file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the “Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction” subsection of the “Miscellaneous” Section. If TeenVoice prevails on your claim in arbitration, and the arbitrator finds that your claim was frivolous or filed in bad faith, the arbitrator may award TeenVoice reimbursement from you of TeenVoice’s arbitration filing fees and costs.
Offer of Settlement. Each of you and TeenVoice may, but is not obligated to, make a written offer to settle your claim at least 14 days before the arbitration hearing date. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If an award is issued in a party’s favor but is less than the other party’s settlement offer, the arbitrator may order such party to pay the arbitration costs incurred by such other party after its offer was made, unless otherwise prohibited by the underlying law governing your claim.
Class Action Waiver. YOU AND TEENVOICE AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF YOU AND TEENVOICE MAY BRING CLAIMS (WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLAIMANT, OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. This also means that you and TeenVoice may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, coordinated, private attorney general, request for public injunctive relief, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding this provision or any other language in these Commercial Terms, you or TeenVoice may participate in a class-wide settlement. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND TEENVOICE WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to These Commercial Terms” Section, if TeenVoice modifies any terms of this “Arbitration” Section after the date you first accepted these Commercial Terms or any subsequent changes to these Commercial Terms, you may reject the new changes to this “Arbitration” Section by sending us written notice, personally signed by you, by certified mail to the attention of TeenVoice’s Legal Department at the at the following address within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the “Last Modified” date of the Commercial Terms you seek to reject: 33 Arch Street, Suite 2100, Boston, MA 02110. Even if you reject a change, you will remain subject to this “Arbitration” Section of the last version of the Commercial Terms you had accepted.
Severability. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this “Arbitration” Section unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then you and TeenVoice agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies; all other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this “Arbitration” Section, and all other Commercial Terms shall continue to be enforceable and valid.
Third-Party Beneficiaries. All TeenVoice Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of this “Arbitration” Section.

Understanding Today’s Teens 

In an era where digital natives are reshaping the world, understanding the life of a modern teen is critical.
